## Problem statement
AtliQ Hardware is a business with several offices across India that provides computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to its customers. The company's sales director is having a lot of trouble understanding how the firm is doing and what challenges it is now experiencing because sales are below expectations and steadily falling. Additionally, as a result of human nature, whenever the sales director calls the regional managers to inquire about the state of the market and sales, they tend to sugarcoat the information and send a ton of Excel files rather than providing the straight story, which only served to aggravate the sales director. The obvious cause of the annoyance is that people find it uncomfortable to read numbers from Excel files.

## Solution
Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions. 

## Steps Followed in this project
1. Performed a High level analysis of data in SQL to get better understanding over the data.
2. Connected the SQL data set to PowerBI.
3. Performed ETL and data cleaning on the imported data.
4. In the currency there were two types of currencies in transactions, performed currency conversion to make all the currency type same
5. Created measures according to our needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi.
6. After the initial report reviewed by the stakeholders, made changes to the report based on the review comments.
